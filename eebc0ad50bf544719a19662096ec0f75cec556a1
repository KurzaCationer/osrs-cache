Task: Research asset counts and document mapping.
Summary: Identified that Index 255 (Reference Table) contains the metadata needed to count assets (archives per index or files per archive). Mapped specific categories like Items (2/10), NPCs (2/9), and Maps (Index 5).
Files: Modified api-reference.md, plan.md; Created research_mapping.md.
Why: To provide the foundation for the loader implementation fixes.
